# Word List Generator

## Description

This script is a proof of concept put together due too the need of word lists that was hard to either find or where
not existing at the time of development.

This script makes it possible to create word lists with printable characters within the ASCII range between \x20 and \xFE

The word lists generated by this script can easily be used with tools like [John The Ripper][1] or [THC Hydra][2].
